    "## WHAT'S JUPYTER NOTEBOOK?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is a free and open source web application that integrates codes along with their outputs, markdown, visualization and equations (using LaTeX typesetting) in a single file that makes the presentation of the procedure and results of a project more intuitive. It is a web-based application (runs in a web browser).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning that notebooks promote collabrative works since they can be shared and edited by different people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter supports 3 core programming languages and that's where it name comes from;\n",
    "- Julia\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- R\n",
    "\n",
    "## COMPONENTS OF JUPYTER NOTEBOOK\n",
    "1. __THE KERNEL:__ The notebook is run by the kernel. _'The kernel could be thought of as the heart of the notebook'_.  It is the program that executes the lines of code in a notebook. The default kernel programming language is Python.\n",
    "2. __CELLS:__ The cells are the place where we write texts or lines of code. The are two kinds of cells;\n",
    "    - _Code Cells:_ The content in this cell is interpreted by the current kernel's programming language. The output of the code is shown below the code cell when the cell is run.\n",
    "    - _Markdown Cells:_ These cells allow us to write formatted text, insert images. Markdown is a lightweight markup language. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this course/discussion, we will use google colab hence we skip the installation process for jupyter notebook.\n"
