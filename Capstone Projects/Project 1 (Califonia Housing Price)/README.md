# CALIFONIA HOUSING PRICE PREDICTION


## Description
- The US Census Bureau has published California Census Data which has 10 types of metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. The dataset also serves as an input for project scoping and tries to specify the functional and nonfunctional r requirements for it.


## Problem
- The project aims at building a model of housing prices to predict median house values in California using the provided dataset. This model should learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.
- Districts or block groups are the smallest geographical units for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). There are 20,640 districts in the project dataset.


## Tasks
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Preprocess the data to make it ready for model building (encode categorical features, standardize or normalize numerical features, handle missing values, etc).
1. Identify the type of machine learning this project falls under briefly explain it in your own words (In your report).
1. Build and train model of housing prices to predict median house values in California using the provided dataset.
1. Predict housing prices based on median_income and plot the regression chart for it.
1. Check the performance of the model using various metrics familiar to you (perform hyperparameter tuning if necessary).
1. Write a brief report (no more than 5 pages) of your project. The report should at least include
    - a brief description of the dataset used
    - a brief overview of the machine learning algorithm used
    - a brief overview of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model and what they mean
    - results and interpretation
